# cal - proleptic gregorian month calendar with coloring

This app tries to match `wsl ncal 10 2023 -b` output and was written as an excersize from the Command-Line Rust book. It doesn't follow the book solution though, but retains much of the tests (that were fixed to allows weeks that start on Monday, colorization and a different way to render the calendar).
